# pi-devin-plus

A [Pi](https://pi.dev) package that uses **Devin Local** models inside Pi — an enhanced fork of [kashyab12/pi-devin](https://github.com/kashyab12/pi-devin).

Pi stays the harness. The [Devin CLI](https://docs.devin.ai/cli) owns login and the live model catalog (`devin auth`, `devin models list`). This is not an ACP integration and does not use Zed.

## What this fork adds over upstream

- **Thinking + sealed-signature replay** — the model's own reasoning is replayed across turns (wire fields 11/12/13/18), so long agent loops keep coherent reasoning instead of restarting blind.
- **Devin Desktop sign-in reuse** — if the Devin CLI store is empty but Devin Desktop is signed in, the Desktop session token is imported instead of forcing a browser round-trip. `/devin-status` shows which credential source is in use.
- **Thinking-level model variants** — reasoning families register under a single family id (e.g. `devin/claude-opus-5`) and pi's thinking level (Shift+Tab / `/thinking`) picks the variant, instead of baking `-high` into the model id. Unsupported levels are explicitly hidden.
- **No crash on mid-stream socket close** — a dropped connection during streaming no longer takes the process down via an unhandled rejection.
- **CLI-aligned request shape** — cascade trajectory reference (field 15) and field 20 sent alongside upstream's promptId (field 22), matching what the Devin CLI puts on the wire.

All of this is rebased onto upstream's pi ≥ 0.86 `TranscriptContext` API; upstream's test suite passes unchanged.

## Why the upstream exists

`pi-devin-auth` treated Devin as Cascade cloud chat. Models like Sol High, Opus 5, and Fable 5 then failed with:

```text
This model is only in Devin Local.
```

Those models are available through the local Devin CLI. This package uses that CLI for auth + catalog, then streams completions into Pi so Pi's tools, sessions, and UI stay in charge.

## Requirements

- Pi Coding Agent 0.86+
- A signed-in [Devin CLI](https://docs.devin.ai/cli) (`devin auth status`)
- Node 22.19+ (required by Pi 0.86)

The CLI binary is resolved in this order:

1. `$DEVIN_CLI`
2. `~/.local/bin/devin`, Homebrew, `/usr/local/bin/devin`
3. Devin.app's bundled `devin` binary
4. `which devin`

## Install

From git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/kashyab12/pi-devin
```

From npm:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-devin
```

Version 0.2.0 requires Pi 0.86+ and Node 22.19+. It restores system instructions and tools on the current Pi transcript format and sends system instructions through Devin's dedicated prompt field. Version 0.1.2 predates Pi 0.86 support.

`pi-devin-local` is a separate npm package maintained in the [mizorewww/pi-devin fork](https://github.com/mizorewww/pi-devin). Changes merged here do not update that package. Install only one: both packages register the `devin` provider, so their registrations can overwrite each other.

Local checkout:

```bash
pi install /Users/kashyab/pi-devin
```

Restart Pi or run `/reload`.

## Usage

```text
/login devin
/model devin/claude-opus-5-high
/model devin/claude-5-fable-high
/model devin/gpt-5-6-sol-high
```

`/login devin` runs `devin auth login` if `~/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml` is missing. If you already signed in through the Devin CLI or Devin Desktop, that file is reused.

Commands:

- `/devin-status` — CLI path, version, auth
- `/devin-refresh` — reload `devin models list --format json`

## What this is / is not

| This package | Not this package |
|---|---|
| Pi is the agent | Devin taking over the session |
| Devin CLI for auth + catalog | Fake Windsurf OAuth paste flow |
| Live CLI families (Opus 5, Fable 5, Sol, …) | Hardcoded 11-model cloud allowlist |
| Completions streamed into Pi tools | An editor host for Devin |

## Publish

This is a standard Pi package (`keywords: ["pi-package"]` + `pi.extensions`). After you push to npm with that keyword, it can show up on [pi.dev/packages](https://pi.dev/packages).
